This requires pynetbox, please install it or you'll have a bad time.

This script so far is very specific and strange, just for my own use case.
It takes all the IPs and Devices from Netbox, and looks for serial numbers
in the descriptions of the IP addresses, and attempts to pair them with
devices with matching serial numbers on interface 50, and make it the main
IP of the device.

Since Netbox has IP addresses and Devices as separate objects, it's not
so easy to import both at the same time, unless you use a custom Python
script, which I'll probably code at some point in the future. Doing this
makes my life so much easier when trying to get everything imported.
